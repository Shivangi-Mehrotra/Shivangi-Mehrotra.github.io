  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a data analyst with a strong analytical mindset and a professional
    background in teaching and mentoring, which has strengthened my
    problem-solving and communication skills.
  </p>
  <p>
    Transitioning from teaching to data analytics, I bring a structured
    approach to data interpretation, pattern recognition, and insight
    communication. My experience in education has enabled me to explain
    complex information clearly — a critical skill in data storytelling.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have hands-on experience working with Python, SQL, ETL pipelines,
    Tableau dashboards, and AWS services. I am passionate about transforming
    raw data into actionable insights that support informed decision-making.
